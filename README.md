My portfolio website for Coder Academy Term 1 Assessment 2.

### 21.10.30
I have created the wireframes for my portfolio pages. I decided to try going with a more simple design and will begin choosing a colour pallet that will elevate the simple look.
I have also written down checklists and ToDo lists for the assignment.
### 21.11.01
I have selected the first set of fonts to use for headers and body text.
Wireframes have been redone with a traditional navbar instead of a hamburger style button because even thought it can be done in CSS, I would rather do it in JavaScript but do not have the knowledge on how to do so. It would be unwise of me to put code into my website without fully understanding it.
