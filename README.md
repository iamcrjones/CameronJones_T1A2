## Purpose
The purpose of this website is to act as a portfolio to show off my skills and the work I have done to potential employers. This website contains methods of contact, some information about me and also demonstrates my web development skills I have learned so far.

## Features and Functionality

This is the first website that I have made while keeping responsiveness and accessibility in mind throughout the project, making sure it passes audit tests so that it is easily accessible which has helped me improve my site to be stable and loads quickly.

## Components

Many components were designed so that interaction with my portfolio is easy and engaging to use:

* Nav bar allows users to navigate the website and navigate
* Footer with social icons which are used as a means of contact with others
* Cards with previews of blog posts that link to the full article
* Main to contain content styling and keep separate from body content
